  This file defines data extraction rules for backing up and transferring
  application data. It specifically targets shared preferences.

  For cloud backup and device transfer, all files under the shared preferences
  domain are included here. If in the future you need to exclude certain files,
  or include other domains (such as files or databases), update the rules accordingly.

    <!--
      Cloud Backup:
      Include all shared preferences to ensure key configuration settings are preserved
      during cloud backup. Adjust the path if only specific preference files should be backed up.
    -->
    <cloud-backup>
        <include domain="sharedpref" path="."/>
    </cloud-backup>

    <!--
      Device Transfer:
      Similarly, include all shared preferences for device-to-device transfer processes.
      Modify the rules here to include or exclude additional domains as needed.
    -->
    <device-transfer>
        <include domain="sharedpref" path="."/>

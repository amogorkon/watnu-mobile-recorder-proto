# C-Tune Clock: Time as Nature Intended

## What is C-Tune?
C-Tune Clock is a beautifully simple Android app that shows two time formats:
- **UTC** â€” the official global clock.
- **CTU** â€” a natural time system based on the sun's position over your location.

Instead of rigid time zones and daylight saving rules, CTU reflects solar noonâ€”so noon really feels like midday, wherever you are.

## Why It Matters
Modern time is practical, but itâ€™s not intuitive. C-Tune Clock gives you a different perspective: a time thatâ€™s anchored to nature, not policy.

## What Youâ€™ll See
- A clean, real-time display of **UTC** and **CTU**.
- Subtle animations and thoughtful styling.
- No clutterâ€”just time, naturally.

## How It Works
- Grabs your location (with permission) or makes a smart guess.
- Calculates CTU based on where you are on Earth.
- Updates every second to stay perfectly in sync.

## First-Time Experience
When you launch the app:
1. You'll get a quick intro to CTU.
2. The app may ask for location access.
3. Youâ€™ll see both clocks tickingâ€”UTC and your solar time.

- Display solar noon, dawn, and dusk.
- Even smoother updates with JavaScript.

## Final Thought
C-Tune Clock isn't just a clockâ€”it's a shift in perspective. Time doesnâ€™t have to be standardized. It can be personal, grounded, and a little more poetic. Explore the beauty of time with C-Tune.
